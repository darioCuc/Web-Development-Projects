# Challenge

## Objectives

1. **Displaying the Current Time**: Utilize the following code snippet to get the current time and display it in an `<h1>` element when the "Get Time" button is pressed.
   ```javascript
   let time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
   console.log(time);
```


Auto-updating Time Every Second: Implement the `setInterval` method to continuously update the displayed time in your `<h1>` element every second, creating a dynamic clock on your webpage.

// function sayHi() {
//   console.log("Hey");
// }
// setInterval(sayHi, 1000);


Replace the sayHi function with a function that updates the <h1> element with the current time, achieving a live clock feature.
