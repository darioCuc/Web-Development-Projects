# React Contact Challenge :telephone_receiver:

## Introduction

Welcome to the **React Contact Challenge**! If you think you've got what it takes to tame the wild beasts of React state and events, you're in the right place. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves bringing a single contact to life in the digital realm. This isn't just any contact, thoughâ€”it's one with a first name, last name, and an email. Sounds easy? We'll see about that!

## Challenge Overview

Your quest is located in the mystical lands of `App.jsx`. The code therein is but a skeleton, yearning for the breath of functionality. You are the wizard that will imbue it with life, using your arcane knowledge of React.

### Objectives

- **Summon a Contact**: You must conjure a single contact entity, complete with a `fName` (first name), `lName` (last name), and `email`.

### Ingredients of the Spell

1. **JS Objects with State**: Your primary incantation. You'll bind the essence of the contact to your app's state.
2. **Previous State Alchemy**: Change is constant. When updating your contact's state, you must weave in the old with the new.
3. **Form Conjuration**: Create a form through which the mortal world can interact with your contact.
4. **Event Handling Rituals**: Listen to the whispers of the form. When it speaks, you shall respond, ensuring the data flows as intended.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Open `App.jsx` and let your journey begin. The comments within are like signposts, guiding your path.

## Hints & Tips

- Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use your state wisely.
- The form is your bridge to the user. Craft it with care.
- Events are the messengers of the user's will. Handle them with respect.
