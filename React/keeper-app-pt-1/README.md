# Keeper App Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run your React application:

### 1. Create a New React App

Start by creating a new React app. If you have `npx` installed, you can do this by running:

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app

Replace `my-app` with the name of your project.

### 2. App.jsx Component

Create an `App.jsx` component. This will serve as the main component where other components like `Header`, `Footer`, and `Note` will be included.

### 3. Header.jsx Component

Create a `Header.jsx` component that renders a `<header>` element to display the Keeper App name within an `<h1>` tag.

### 4. Footer.jsx Component

Create a `Footer.jsx` component that renders a `<footer>` element. It should display a copyright message inside a `<p>` tag, with the year dynamically updated.

### 5. Note.jsx Component

Create a `Note.jsx` component that will display a note. It should consist of a `<div>` element containing a `<h1>` tag for the title and a `<p>` tag for the content.

### 6. Website Styling

Ensure that the final website is styled according to the example provided. You can view the example at:
